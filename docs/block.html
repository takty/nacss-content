		<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
			vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
			domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
		<p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
			compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.
			It wasn't a dream. </p>
		<p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole
			of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
