		<h2>Floating Figures</h2>

		<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
			vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
			domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
			off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
			he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.</p>
		<figure class="alignleft">

		<p>It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
			familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and
			above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded
			frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered
			the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
